This is a simple prototype that shows one how to retrive data from a MySQL Spatial database
and render it to the screen using the Raphaël library (http://raphaeljs.com/)

1. First read shp2sqp/README
2. Then look at the file app/views/main/index.html.erb

Be aware that if you use a large SHP file the rendering will be extremely slow.
