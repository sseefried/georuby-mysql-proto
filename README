This is a simple prototype that shows one how to retrive data from a MySQL Spatial database
and render it to the screen using the Raphaël library (http://raphaeljs.com/)

1. First read shp2sqp/README
2. Then look at the file app/views/main/index.html.erb

Be aware that if you use a large SHP file the rendering will be extremely slow.

One thing that may happen when you run shp2sql.rb is that you get a MySQL exception:

   Got a packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes

If this happens just log in to mysql client as root and type:

mysql> set global max_allowed_packet=99999744

Or you can edit /etc/my.conf

------

[mysqld]

max_allowed_packet=99999744


------
