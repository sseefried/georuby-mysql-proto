I (Sean Seefried) haven't been able to put the shape files in here
since they are confidential (and besdies, they're too big) but the
idea is that you copy in the .dbf, .shp, .shx, .sbx, .qix, .sbn, .fix,
for a given geograph area and then run the following command:

% ruby shp2sql.rb <file.shp>

Should should see output akin to:

...
...
...
-- add_column("some_shape", "the_geom", :multi_polygon, {:null=>false})
   -> 0.0736s
-- add_index("some_shape", "the_geom", {:spatial=>true})
   -> 0.0934s


This will create a table in the database with the same base name (the
file name without the .shp extension) as the shape file.

Then in app/models you need to create a model (which can have any name you see fit) with at least teh following in it:

class ModelName < ActiveRecord::Base
  set_table_name 'shape_file_name' # Or whatever table shp2sql/shp2sql.rb generated
end
